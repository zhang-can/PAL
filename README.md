## Updates

* We will release our codes and models soon, please stay tuned!

## Highlights

* This is the FIRST work focusing on **Unsupervised Pre-training for Temporal Action Localization (UP-TAL)**.

* We design an intuitive and effective pretext task customized for TAL, called **Pseudo Action Localization (PAL)**.

* Our PAL features transfer well on various TAL tasks: Temporal Action Detection (TAD), Action Proposal Generation (APG) and Video Grounding (VG).

Given a video (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\boldsymbol{v}_i">), we randomly sample two pseudo action regions from it and then paste them onto another two pseudo background videos (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\boldsymbol{v}_n"> & <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\boldsymbol{v}_m">) at various temporal locations and scales. PAL learns temporal equivariant features by aligning pseudo action region features (<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\boldsymbol{r}_q"> & <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\boldsymbol{r}_{k%2B}">) and maximizing the agreement between region features of the same video but with different backgrounds.
